stmortem for my E-commerce Site

Issue Summary:

Duration of Outage: 2 hours (May 13, 2023, 2:00 PM - May 13, 2023, 4:00 PM EST)
Impact: The login and registration functionality on our e-commerce website were down, affecting approximately 30% of our users who were unable to access their accounts and make purchases.

Root Cause: A software update to the authentication server resulted in a misconfiguration of the database connection pool, leading to a bottleneck and subsequent failure.

Timeline:

- 2:00 PM: The issue was detected when our monitoring system alerted us to a high volume of errors related to authentication.
- 2:05 PM: The engineering team began investigating the issue, initially assuming it was a problem with the database server.
- 2:15 PM: After a series of database tests, it was determined that the issue was not with the database itself.
- 2:30 PM: Further investigation revealed a misconfiguration of the database connection pool in the authentication server code.
- 3:00 PM: The team attempted several debugging paths that turned out to be dead ends, leading to wasted time and effort.
- 3:30 PM: The incident was escalated to the senior engineering team for additional support and resources.
- 4:00 PM: The issue was resolved by reverting the recent authentication server software update and reconfiguring the connection pool settings.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration of the database connection pool in the authentication server code, resulting in a bottleneck and subsequent failure. The issue was fixed by reverting the recent authentication server software update and reconfiguring the connection pool settings to optimize performance and ensure scalability.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar issues in the future, the engineering team will implement the following corrective and preventative measures:

- Conduct a thorough review of the authentication server codebase to identify and address potential issues.
- Improve our monitoring and alerting system to provide earlier detection of similar issues and more detailed error reporting.
- Implement automated testing and deployment processes to ensure software updates are thoroughly tested and validated before deployment.
- Develop a comprehensive incident response plan with clear escalation paths and roles and responsibilities defined in advance.
- Schedule regular code reviews and team training sessions to ensure all team members are up to date on best practices and new technologies. 

TODOs:

- Review and update the database connection pool configuration settings.
- Conduct a code review of all recent authentication server updates.
- Develop a comprehensive incident response plan.
- Improve monitoring and alerting system for earlier detection of similar issues.
- Schedule regular training sessions for the engineering team.
